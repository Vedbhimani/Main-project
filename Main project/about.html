        <h4>About Twizzlers Candy</h4>
        <p>TWIZZLERS Candy got its start at the Young & Smylie Confectionery Company in 1845. This iconic licorice candy gained generations of fans including Astronaut Neil Armstrong who, while on the moon, said: “I could go for some TWIZZLERS right now.”
            <br>
            The Hershey Company welcomed TWIZZLERS Twists into the family in 1977, and gave candy lovers a brave new world of flavors to enjoy.
            <br>
            As if a space shoutout wasn’t exciting enough, TWIZZLERS Candy made it into the Guinness World Record Book in 1998 for the longest piece of licorice ever made: 1200 feet and 100 pounds</p>
